CMake Warning at CMakeLists.txt:38 (find_package):
  By not providing "FindGALIB.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "GALIB", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "GALIB" with any of
  the following names:

    GALIBConfig.cmake
    galib-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "GALIB" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "GALIB_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "GALIB"
  provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
  installed.


CMake Error at controllers/foraging_redteam/CMakeLists.txt:17 (add_library):
  add_library cannot create target "foraging_0" because another target with
  the same name already exists.  The existing target is a module library
  created in source directory
  "/home/shlomi/Documents/GitHub/Intro-to-Robotics/krembot_ws/controllers/foraging_0".
  See documentation for policy CMP0002 for more details.


CMake Error at controllers/foraging_redteam/CMakeLists.txt:19 (target_link_libraries):
  Attempt to add link library "Krembot" to target "foraging_0" which is not
  built in this directory.

  This is allowed only when policy CMP0079 is set to NEW.
